          <p style={{ "text-align": "justify" }}>Welcome to <b>SimpsonsVQA AI Challenge 2024</b>, a unique AI challenge crafted to foster a community of researchers, educators,
            and developers committed to leveraging Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enhance early-age education. This initiative
            is centered on utilizing VQA as a dynamic tool to facilitate improved learning experiences for young learners.

          <h5>Challenge Objectives:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> This challenge aims to establish a collaborative environment where
              professionals from various domains can engage, share insights, and work together to advance VQA
              applications in education.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation in Education:</strong> Participants will contribute to developing and refining
              next-generation educational tools designed for young learners through the implementation of VQA in
              educational settings.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section style={{ "text-align": "justify" }}>
          <h5>Challenge Tasks:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Conventional VQA:</strong> Participants will work on traditional VQA problems, creating
              algorithms capable of answering visually presented questions accurately and efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Question Relevance VQA:</strong> Develop systems that can effectively determine the relevance of
              posed questions to the given visual content, ensuring educationally valuable interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Answer Correctness VQA:</strong> This task requires participants to devise solutions that,
              given an image, a question, and an answer, can efficiently evaluate the provided triple as Incorrect,
              Ambiguous, or Correct. The system should be able to perform this evaluation accurately to facilitate a
              more supportive learning experience for children.</li>
          </ol>

        <h2 class="text-success ">Evaluation</h2>
        <p style={{ "text-align": "justify" }}>We employ the standard  <b>Accuracy</b> metric as our primary evaluation criterion. Additionally, 
          recognizing the class imbalance for the Question Relevance task and the Answer Correctness task,
          we also utilize the <b>Precision</b>, <b>Recall</b>, <b>F1-score</b>, and <b>AUC score</b> to provide a comprehensive assessment
           of model performance.</p>
